I'm Autumn Lewis, a detail-oriented and process-driven professional with a strong background in student account management and education benefits. Outside of work, I enjoy contributing to meaningful projects that involve organization, problem-solving, and collaboration. I bring a thoughtful, forward-thinking approach to everything I take on and value clarity, efficiency, and impact in all aspects of my work. I also love to kayak and hike and I have the most amazing 7 year old in the world :)
